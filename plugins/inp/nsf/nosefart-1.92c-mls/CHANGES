1.92c-mls

Merged in the CL-amp plugin for BeOS.  I don't know if it actually works 
yet, since I don't have BeOS, but hopefully someone will test it and get 
back to me.

Made it compile in FreeBSD.  I don't know if it actually works, tho, since I only 
have a shell account.  Someone tell me, please...

1.92b-mls

First sourceforge release.  I've improved the Linux frontend.  Now you can 
see what channels are enabled, these channels persist over track changes 
and if you advance past the last track, it loops back to the first.
