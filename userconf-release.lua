--- @brief    dcplaya lua user script.
---
--- @par userconf.lua
---
---   There is two version of this file. The first version should be in dcplaya
---   home directory, the second should have been extracted from the VMU
---   into the ramdisk "/ram/dcplaya/". These two versions are optionnal files.
---   They are executed by the dcplayarc.lua in this order. By the way their
---   execution can be skip by setting respectively skip_home_userconf and
---   skip_vmu_userconf variables. Since the home userconf is executed before
---   the VMU one, the only possiblity to set these variables is to do it in
---   the VMU dcplayarc.lua. This mechanism should be enought for any user to
---   configure its dcplaya at will (or so I hope).
---   Having an home userconf.lua file instead of doing all initialization
---   stuff in dcplayarc.lua is a development facility purpose. Each
---   dcplaya developper can have its own userconf.lua depending on its
---   need and behaviour. Because this file is subject to a lot of
---   modifications it will be a real nightmare to include it to the CVS
---   repository.
---
--- @par Default behaviours
---
---   The default userconf.lua file do the following things in this order
---   only if the __RELEASE variable is set:
---     -# Loading almost all drivers (plugins) in suitable order.
---     -# Check and load if missing the entry_list driver that should
---        have been loaded by the dcplayarc.lua
---     -# Check and load if missing the jpeg driver that should
---        have been loaded by the dcplayarc.lua
---     -# Load some dcplaya lua libraries with dolib() function. This will
---        start all standard applications neccessary for most users:
---          -# @link dcplaya_lua_background background @endlink,
---             load default background.
---          -# @link dcplaya_lua_cc_app control_center @endlink,
---             launch control-center application
---          -# @link dcplaya_lua_si_app song_info @endlink,
---             launch song-info  application
---          -# @link dcplaya_lua_sb_app song_browser @endlink,
---             launch and get focus on the song-browser application.
---     -# Randomly set a vmu visual.
---     -# Randomly set a visual plugin if none is set.
