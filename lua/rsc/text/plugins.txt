<p><apres><left><body-font>
Plugins are external program that allow dcplaya developers or third party
developer to add new features without the need to change version.<br>
Plugins are available as files which should have a ".lef" or ".lez" extension.
A ".lez" file is the same than ".lef" except it has been compressed with
gzip utility.

At the time these lines are written there is no real dcplaya place for
the plugin. You had to check out dcplaya web-site.

input plugin are probably the most important plugin category. It is used to
add new playable music format. A input plugin adds a new music file-type. It
provides a file loader, a decoder and information on the music (author,
bit-rate, duration ...).

visual plugins provides visual effects. Nothing more to tell here except that
visual plugin can have many options but dcplaya do not offer a nice gui to set
them. Advanced users can use dcplaya console to change them.

image plugins are used by dcplaya to load image file. Images could be use
for multiple purposes. First images can be used as wallpaper for dcplaya
background. It can be used by the graphic API (icons, sprites, textures...).
Images plugins add a new image file-type and provides a file loader and
information on this files (resolution, color space...).

object plugins adds 3d objects that can be used by visual plugins. Current
object plugin API is really poor and would probably be change in the future.

executable plugins main purpose is to had functionalities to the dcplaya LUA
interpretor. It adds new functions that could be run from dcplaya console or by
dcplaya scripts. executable plugins are not limited to this. In fact it can do
anything like patching dcplaya or whatever.
