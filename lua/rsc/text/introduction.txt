<p><apres><left><body-font>
dcplaya is a free music player for the dreamcast.

<p><apres>
It can play most popular music file formats such as mp3, ogg-vorbis, most
tracker file formats (xm,mod,s3m...) and some old school sound-chip formats
like sc68 and sid.

<p><apres>
Other formats can be easily added by third party developer without changing
dcplaya version.  

<p><apres>
dcplaya has many other features such as image file handling,
visual effects ... The list is far too long.
