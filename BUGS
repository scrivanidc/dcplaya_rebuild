 * @par		Filetype corruption at driver load/remove.
 * @date	2002/09/18
 * @author	ben
 *
 *  Loading/removing input driver makes filetype error. Removed driver does
 *  not free its id which is used as filetype. songmenu.c can not find the
 *  driver back.
 *  Need to alloc/free filetype correctly in driver_list.c.

 *
 *  Hacked : songmenu retrieves the filetype again in case it does not found
 *  a suitable driver. This is probably not a very clean solution to this
 *  problem but it fix the input plugin reload !
